      <p class="col-lg-3 col-md-2">Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings.<br>&copy; google <span id="span1">Where they come from ?</span></p>
      <p class="col-lg-3 col-md-2">The event horizon is the one-way-filter in the black hole:anything can enter, but nothing can leave.A black hole is a very simple object:it has three properties mass,spin and electrical charge. Because of the way in which black holes form,their electrical charge is zero,which makes them simpler.<br>&copy; google <span id="span2"> Properties</span></p>
      <p class="col-lg-3 col-md-1">The black hole information paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Calculations suggest that physical information could permanently disappear in a black hole, allowing many physical states to devolve into the same state. <br>&copy;Vikipedia <span id="span3"> Information Paradox</span></p>
